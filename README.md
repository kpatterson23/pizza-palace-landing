# Pizza Palace

## What is this project?

Pizza Palace is a landing page for an imaginary pizza resturant. 

## Why build this project?

I built this project mainly because I was hungry and pizza is my favorite food! But mainly because my favorite local pizza resturant has a pretty outdated looking website, so most people tend to order from Uber Eats or Grubhub. Given all the service fees, I'm sure the cost of doing business this was is weighing on the resturant. 
My hope is that by building this landing page, I can one day acquire the skills necessary to build a full replacement for their business and give it to them for free. I also wanted to challenge myself to something I hadn't tried before which was to redesign a website using a live website as a starting point. 

### What's next?

My next goal with this project to flesh out the rest of the website, add more pages, and a secure checkout payment system.
